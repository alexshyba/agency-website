# CardGridSection Uniform Integration - Setup Complete

## Overview
Successfully integrated the CardGridSection component with Uniform CMS, following all best practices and requirements from the workspace rules.

## Completed Work

### 1. Component Refactoring
- **CardGridSection**: Updated to use Uniform parameter types (`UniformText`, `UniformSlot`)
- **Individual Card Components**: Created separate components for modularity
  - `ServiceCard` - For service offerings with icon, title, description
  - `ProjectCard` - For portfolio items with image, title, description, tags
  - `ProcessStep` - For process workflow steps with icon, title, description

### 2. Component Registration
- All components registered in `uniform/resolve.ts`:
  - `cardGridSection` → CardGridSection
  - `serviceCard` → ServiceCard  
  - `projectCard` → ProjectCard
  - `processStep` → ProcessStep

### 3. Uniform Component Definitions
Created YAML definitions following Uniform schema:
- `cardGridSection.yaml` - Main grid section with configurable slots
- `serviceCard.yaml` - Service card with icon, title, description parameters
- `projectCard.yaml` - Project card with image asset and text parameters
- `processStep.yaml` - Process step with icon and text parameters

### 4. Component Patterns
Created example patterns with real content:
- Service card patterns for DXP Strategy, Platform Implementation, Experience Design
- Process step patterns for Discovery & Strategy, Design & Prototyping
- CardGridSection pattern demonstrating the services variant

### 5. Key Features Implemented
- **Responsive Grid Layouts**: Services (3-col), Portfolio (3-col), Process (5-col)
- **Slot-based Architecture**: Cards slot configured with `allowAllComponents=true`, `inheritAllowedComponents=false`, `patternsInAllowedComponents=false`
- **Parameter Overridability**: All pattern parameters set as overridable by default
- **Proper Parameter Types**: Text, select, asset with appropriate guidance
- **Accessibility**: Alt text parameters for images
- **Styling Integration**: Tailwind CSS classes for backgrounds and styling

```

## Next Steps Required

### 1. Environment Setup
To complete the integration, set up environment variables in `.env`:
```bash
UNIFORM_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
UNIFORM_API_KEY=your_api_key_with_read_write_permissions
UNIFORM_PREVIEW_SECRET=hello-world
```

### 2. Push to Uniform
Once environment variables are configured:
```bash
pnpm uniform:push
```

### 3. Verify in Uniform Dashboard
1. Check that components appear in the Component Library
2. Verify patterns are available for use
3. Test creating new compositions with CardGridSection

### 4. Usage in Compositions
The CardGridSection can now be:
- Added to any composition
- Configured with different variants (services, portfolio, process)
- Populated with card patterns or individual cards
- Customized with titles, backgrounds, and styling

## Component Benefits
- **Modular Design**: Individual card types can be reused across different sections
- **Content Flexibility**: Authors can mix different card types in the same grid
- **Pattern Reuse**: Pre-built patterns for common use cases
- **Responsive**: Automatic grid adjustments based on variant
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new card types or grid variants

## Technical Notes
- All components follow Uniform parameter naming conventions
- Proper TypeScript integration with ComponentProps
- Slot configuration follows workspace rules for reusability
- Pattern overridability enables customization while maintaining consistency
- Asset handling implemented for project card images
